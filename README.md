# Connectify - Social Network Application

Connectify is a simple yet feature-rich Android-based social media application that I built as a personal project during college to explore and learn Android development. It lets users sign up, log in, and customize their profiles while connecting with others through real-time chat and post sharing. Users can follow or unfollow others, like, comment on, and save postsâ€”offering an engaging and interactive experience.

The app is developed using Java/XML in Android Studio, with Firebase Realtime Database and Firebase Authentication handling the backend. It also makes use of Android Architecture Components to maintain a clean and scalable structure. This project helped me understand the full flow of a social media app, from user authentication to data handling and real-time interactions.
